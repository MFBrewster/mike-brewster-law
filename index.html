      <h2>Estate Planning: Questions and Answers</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="question"><h5>What does estate planning do for me?</h5></div>
        <div class="answer"><p>A professionally drafted will, power of attorney,
                            health care proxy, and trust dramatically eases the
                            difficulty family members must encounter when faced
                            with the loss of a loved one.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="question"><h5>Why not use a form from LegalZoom?</h5></div>
        <div class="answer"><p>While form documents are usually better than having no documents
                            at all, only an experienced attorney will be able to
                            evaluate your unique circumstances, identify potential
                            problems or pitfalls, and recommend courses of action to
                            accomplish all of your goals with minimal difficulty for you
                            and your loved ones. A form which is not fitted to your
                            unique circumstances could potentially do more harm than good.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="question"><h5>Is it difficult?</h5></div>
        <div class="answer"><p>Not especially. A comprehensive plan must account for
                            all of your personal and financial circumstances and needs,
                            with backup plans in case of any changes. A typical estate plan can
                            be completed in two meetings of thirty to sixty minutes. You should expect
                            to spend a total of perhaps four hours' time spread out over a month or two.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="question"><h5>Is it expensive?</h5></div>
        <div class="answer"><p>A typical married couple can expect to get wills, powers of
                            attorney, health care proxies, and (if they wish) living wills for
                            less than a thousand dollars. The initial consultation is free
                            of charge.</p></div>

      <h2>About Mike</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="question"><h5>Is Mike an experienced estate planner?</h5></div>
        <div class="answer"><p>I've been running a law practice focused almost exclusively on
                            estate planning since graduating law school in 2010. In that
                            time I have handled more than one hundred clients' cases,
                            delivering robust, professional plans at a reasonable cost.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="question"><h5>What are Mike's hours? Where and when can we meet?</h5></div>
        <div class="answer"><p>I am employed full-time durng working hours, and do legal work
                            on nights and weekends. This makes my estate planning practice
                            especially well-suited for working professionals who find it difficult
                            to create time during the week. I am willing to meet clients at their
                            homes or any other convenient location.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="question"><h5>What's Mike's story?</h5></div>
        <div class="answer"><p>I'm originally from Quincy, Massachusetts. I studied philosphy
                            at Suffolk University, continued on to Suffolk law school, and struck out on my
                            own as an estate planner. After five years of practicing, I changed careers and
                            became a web developer. Using my legal expertise to help clients with estate
                            planning is a very rewarding side gig for the nights and weekends!</p>
                            <p>When not working, I read books, run
                            <a href ="http://meetup.com/The-Red-Line-Book-Club/" target="_blank">
                            the Red Line Book Club</a> in Cambridge, play hockey, and
                            enjoy time with family and friends.</p></div>
