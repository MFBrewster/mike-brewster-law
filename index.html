      <h1>Michael F. Brewster, Attorney at Law</h1>
      <h5>No longer taking new clients.</h5>
      <p>
        For a little while, I practiced law as a self-employed lawyer specializing in trusts,
        estate planning, and elder law. It was great in a lot of ways, I set my own schedule
        and earned my daily bread by helping people navigate the often laborious tasks associated
        with leaving their loved ones with as few legal headaches as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was satisfying as a career, but I found the work uninteresting and didn't have
        the passion for it necessary to drive a business venture to success. Over the past three years,
        I have made an effort to wind down my law practice, and am no longer accepting new clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am thankful for everyone who entrusted me with ensuring their legacy, and believe I provided 
        my clients with great work at significantly lower rates than that for which comparable work was
        available. I learned more than I thought possible, about the law, business, family, people, and
        myself. Walking this path has given me things I could never have otherwise have.

        There are lots of benefits to having a will or  estate plan, but I think one of the most critical
        is the certainty of knowing who will be the guardian of any children or others under your care if
        you're unable to continue doing so. If you're responsible for another person's well-being, you
        should consider reaching out to a lawyer to do this kind of planning.
      </p>
      <p>All the best, honored guest!</p>
